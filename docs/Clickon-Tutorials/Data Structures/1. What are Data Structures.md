# What are Data Structures?

A data structure is a way to store, organize and manage information (or data) in a way that allows a programmer to easily access or modify the values within them.

##### Essentially, it is a way to store a set of relational information that we can use in our programs.

Data structures, and the algorithyms used to interact, modify and search through them, provide the backbone for many programs.

##### The goal of many data structures is to store information and allow an end user to access and manipulate that information in an efficient and effective way.

###### Some examples of basic data structures:
    - Password Databases (arrays)
    - Online Directories (lists)

###### Some examples of advanced data structures:
    - Undo/Redo Function
    - Spell Check
    - Text Search
    - Autocomplete
    - Google Maps on mobile

As you can imagine there are many different types of data structures that each come with their own advantages, disadvantages and use cases.

# Big O Notation

### What is Big O Notation?

Accessing data needs to be fast and efficient. Big O notation is the industry standard used to determine the efficiency of a datastructure. It is a method to score a datastructure based on a few different criteria.

**We want a quantifiable way to measure how efficient certain data structures are at different tasks such as:**

* Seaching
* Modifying
* Accessing

**The most common functions we might want from a data structure are:**

* Searching for an element \( Search\)
* Accessing elements \( Access\)
* Inserting an element \(Modify\)
* Deleting an element \(Modify\)

**By measuring how efficiently a data structure can do these 4 things, we can create a 'Report Card'. This 'report card' gives us an overview of what the data structure is good at, and bad at.**

**Using this knowledge we can make an informed choice of which data structure to choose.**

As an example, if we needed a data structure that allows users quick access, we would prioritize the Access Function in a data structure. We can then use the report card to assess which data structure has the best score for Accessing.

By looking at the report card, we get a sneak peak at what each is good and bad at. The scoring method is called "The Big O Time Complexity Equation"

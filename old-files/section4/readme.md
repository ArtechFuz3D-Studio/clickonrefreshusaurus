HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML
html5 is a set of technologies that define the use and functioning of html

Inline elements are containers that fall vertically.
Block elements are stacked horizontally and take up the whole container

## div
div = The content division provider.
the div is the container
DIV is a block level element, meaning if you add content into the div, it will take up a whole block
div is a container that groups content together

## span 
span is similar to div, but is an inline element
you can use to it to define a class of things within an element, for example to highlight a list of ingrdients in a sentence. You then use css to add style to that *span.
It does not take its own block of content, it is inline.
You can use span to put a tag next to a title like I have been seeing in repositories.

# HTML is a markup language

- It is not a full blown programming language
- It is used to markup documents or pages
- It is a computer syntax for marking documents much like a teacher marking a test paper
- HTML originates from academic research papers as a way of writing papers and sharing over the internet, the scholars needed a standardized way of writing text to be viewable on a web browser, it is a standardised way of transmitting text over the internet.

~ The goal of HTML is to take text and mark it up into some kind of structure

- A basic example of this how text is italicized or bolded, a computer is not your hand and pen, therefore theses formatting styles need a way to be interpreted.

~ The web browser engine uses HTML as a set of instructions on how to display the text content.

An example of basic formatting, if you want italics:
(italics) --> The Dog Jumped Over The Cheese <--(italics)

## As you can imagine if there is multiple formatting styles in 1 sentence, it can quickly become convaluted. This is where HTML Elements come to the rescue.

## HTML Elements

- HTML Elements are defined using a tags:
<tag>this is content</tag>
<paragraph>this is a sentence</paragraph>
<p>paragraph</p>

## HTML Elements:

<p>paragraph</p>

<h1>HEADING 1</h1>

<h2>HEADIng 2</h2>

<h6>heading 6</h6>

<title>Page Title</title>

<i>italics</i>

<b>bold</b>

## HTML tags have an opening tag and a closing tag, but not always

<h3>There are many html elements used in reality, <b>and they are often nested</b></h3>

<h1>So what is html in a nutshell?</h1>
<p>html is used to <b>"make this part bold"</b>, or <link>"Make this a link"</link> or make this paragraph</p>
